 * LAUNCHING → RUNNING: get a real Forge game constructed, started,
 * and as far as its first priority window, which is §6.17's
 * "Forge is alive and authoritative; gameplay input may occur".
 *
 * Routing decisions to a browser is the next slice. Until it
 * exists, both seats pass priority, which means a real game of
 * Magic is played to a real Forge-reported conclusion with nobody
 * doing anything — the players deck out. That is a weak game and a
 * strong proof: Forge ran it, Forge ended it, and Forge said who
 * lost (§6.149).
 *
 * EVERYTHING ELSE INHERITS THE LOUD FAILURE from the generated
 * base, and that is the design rather than an omission. §6.105
 * requires an unsupported required decision to be visible; a
 * controller that guessed would produce a game that looks fine and
 * is subtly not Magic, which is the class of defect the old
 * project shipped.
